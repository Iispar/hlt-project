# hlt-project

project for the intro to human language technology course.


## Basic project outline

The project involves creating a machine learning-based method for a text classification task of your choice. Specifically, you should

1. Select a text classification corpus to work on. (see below)
2. Read the paper presenting the corpus as well as any other relevant published materials about the corpus to assure you understand the data
3. Identify what is the state-of-the-art performance for this corpus (i.e. the best published results). Some corpora (but not all) will have public leaderboards that can help here.
4. Write code to
    1. download the corpus
    2. perform any necessary preprocessing
    3. train a machine learning method on the training set, evaluating performance on the validation set
    4. perform hyperparameter optimization
    5. evaluate your final model on the test set
5. Write a summary of
    1. what you learned about the corpus
    2. your results
    3. how your results relate to the state of the art
    4. if completed as a group project, a section detailing who did what
